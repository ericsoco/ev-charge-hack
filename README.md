# Seed App 2020

Starter React/Redux app w/ basic runtime and build tooling:

- React Router (router)
- Styled Components (styling)
- Parcel (bundler)
- Eslint (linter)
- Prettier (code formatter)
- Husky (commit hooks)
- Volta (toolchain manager)

## Installing

[Install Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) if you haven't already:

```
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

Once Volta is installed and running in your terminal (you may need to open a new session), it will automatically switch to the `node` and `yarn` versions required by the project (per `package.json::volta`).

Then, install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

## Running

```
yarn start
```
